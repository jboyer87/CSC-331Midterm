# CSC-335 Midterm

## Synopsis
The midterm includes a simple project for working with std::list, and iterators.

## Write a C++ program to:
1. Create a standard library std::list container and load it with 100 random doubles.
1. Write an iterator based loop and print out all the elements.
1. Write a function to delete the 75th element in the list.
1. Write a function to find a given double value in this list and return its position in the list if found. If not found your function should throw an exception object defined by you.
